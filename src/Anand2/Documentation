Documentation:
1. Documentation-SystemID-Results: Contains the results of each model under different noise values.

Folders:
1. LR: Simple Linear Regressor
2. Arima: Arima Model for Time Series data
3. RNN: RNN that predicts that takes in the current time step and predicts next time step.
4. RNN10: RNN that takes in the past 10 time steps and predicts next time step.
